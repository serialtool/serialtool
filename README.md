<p><b>What SerialTool?</b></p>
               <p>
                 SerialTool is a professional Serial Port Software to quickly and easily communicate with your PC Serial Port.<br>
                 SerialTool is the result of years of development and implementation of functionalities in the use of the COM port.<br>
                 Many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Terminal_Ready"> features</a> have been designed to facilitate embedded development using the COM (UART) port.<br>
  
Among the various functions it is possible to save buffers, insert alarms when a specific buffer arrives, save serial traffic and much more.<br><br>
</p>
               <p>A super easy tool for Arduino hobbyists to test their application with AutoAnswer functions.<br>
               Ideal for professional users with logging functions and timed multiple packet send for intensive application stress tests.<br>
               SerialTool is available for Windows, Mac OS and Linux.<br>

<p><b>What does it make SerialTool unique?</b></p>
               <p>SerialTool is a multiplatform software which uses native functions for each Operating System and maximizes the performaces of each platform where is runs.<br>
               Its common and intuitive Graphical User Interface makes it easy to use on every enviroment and it is extremly user friend enhancing a lot of features that can be hardly found in other serial port communication softwares.<p>


<p><b>What is a Serial Port</p></b>
               <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Serial port</a> in embedded electronics is all about connecting circuits (processors or other integrated circuits) to create a symbiotic system.
                 In order for those individual circuits to swap their information, they must share a common communication protocol. In most of the cases nowadays it is very common to connect a PC to an <a href="https://www.arduino.cc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Arduino</a> board.<br>
                 There are plenty of applications you can develope but in the majority of cases you need to communicate somehow to the outside world. This is when the Serial port comes in place!<br>
